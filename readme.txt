So far, the technical implementation of paid content has been time-consuming and costly. Plenigo puts an end to this.

== Description ==
So far, the technical implementation of paid content has been time-consuming and costly for publishing houses and media companies. plenigo puts an end to this: Customers receive all the functions they need to implement a professional paid content offer – out-of-the-box, at low, fixed monthly rates. plenigo customers waste no time and effort when installing and operating it on servers of their own, because plenigo is a software-as-a-Service platform.

== Installation ==
1) Install the plugin
2) Enter Plenigo\'s Company ID and Secret
3) Select paywalled tag(s) and add a managed Plenigo Product ID(s)
4) Start getting money from your hard-earned work!
